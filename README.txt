DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO GO IN COMPLETELY BLIND ABOUT THE BOSS:

The boss has two major attack types:

Knockback - the main attack type is a knockback hit dealing 20 damage to the player and knocking them back. This occurs if the player is too close to the boss for long.

DEFENSE - This mode sees the boss become invincible for 8 seconds. while invincible, the boss hurls projectiles from the left side of the screen, varying in speed and accuracy based on how low the boss health is. These projectiles can be straight(just move left to right), jumping(will move up and down) or targeted(targets based on player's location in an arc angle.

The boss also has an ability to heal, everytime the boss goes into defense mode he heals for 15hp, not a lot. But if the potions that the player leaves behind are left untouched for too long, the boss will then float the potion towards itself and consume it for however hp it is worth, healing it.
